# Streaming Twitter and Data Preparation

<p> In this project, we built a dataset of Adverse Reactions to Antidepressant Medications, using the Twitter API to obtain this data in real time.</p>

<p> Once access was granted, we used Python libraries to perform queries and collect tweets, the main one used at this stage being Tweepy. </p>

<p> We used a filter in the script with keywords for antidepressants in 5 different classes (chemical and commercial names) Searches in common formats on the social network, i.e. using the drug "Fluoxetine", we searched for variations such as: @Fluoxetine, #Fluoxetine, Fluoxetine. We also ensured that tweets were filtered by language in "pt" (Portuguese). </p>

<p> The streaming script was run non-stop using an EC2 Linux instance on AWS of type t2.micro, a high-availability cluster. The collection of tweets began on April 14, 2021 and continued for a year and a half. </p>

<p> The data was collected and stored in JSON format in a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB, using the Pymongo library. </p>
